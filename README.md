# Comparative Analysis of WSN Routing Protocols

## Project Description

This project provides a Python-based simulation framework to compare the performance of several cluster-based routing protocols for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).

It includes implementations of four baseline protocols from recent literature and proposes a new enhanced protocol, **CS-Abose**, which integrates Compressive Sensing to improve network lifetime.

## File Descriptions

- `main_comparison.py`: The main executable script to run all simulations.
- `plot_results.py`: A script to visualize the results generated by the main runner.
- `cs_abose_protocol.py`: **(Proposed Method)** Implementation of our Compressive-Sensing-Aware protocol based on Abose et al.
- `abose_protocol.py`: (Baseline) Implementation of the IMP-RES-EL protocol by Abose et al. (2024).
- `eerpms_protocol.py`: (Baseline) Implementation of the EERPMS protocol by Yao et al. (2022).
- `mrpgtco_protocol.py`: (Baseline) Implementation of the MRP-GTCO protocol by Yao et al. (2022).
- `rlbeep_protocol.py`: (Baseline) Implementation of the RLBEEP protocol by Abadi et al. (2022).
- `sector_protocol.py`: (Baseline) Implementation of the Sector-Based protocol by Zeng et al. (2022).

## Instructions to Run

1.  **Set up the Python environment** (do this only once):
    ```bash
    # It seems you already have 'myenv', but if starting fresh:
    python3 -m venv myenv
    source myenv/bin/activate
    pip install pandas matplotlib numpy scikit-learn
    ```

2.  **Run the full simulation**:
    ```bash
    # Make sure your environment is active
    source myenv/bin/activate
    
    # Run the main comparison script
    python main_comparison.py
    ```
    This will create a directory named `simulation_results_final` containing CSV files with the performance data for each protocol.

3.  **Generate the comparison plot**:
    ```bash
    python plot_results.py
    ```
    This will display a graph comparing the network lifetime of all protocols and save it as `comparison_lifetime.png` in the results folder.
